# Play Font for Minecraft

This resource pack replaces the default Minecraft font with Play by Jonas Hecksher.

Play is licensed under the <a href="https://openfontlicense.org/open-font-license-official-text/">SIL Open Font License Version 1.1</a> and the pack resources are licensed under MIT.

The resource pack functions best on 1.20.5 or later, but can still work on earlier versions.  Bold and glow ink result in some distortion due to the way Minecraft creates these effects (by rendering the character multiple times).
